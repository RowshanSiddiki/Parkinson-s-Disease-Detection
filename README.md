# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
This dataset has voice recordings from 31 people (23 with Parkinson's, 8 healthy). There are 195 recordings total, about 6 per person.  Each recording is a row in the data, with a "status" column (1 for Parkinson's, 0 for healthy) and a "name" column for each person. The data is in a CSV file from a 2008 study by Little et al. (IEEE).
